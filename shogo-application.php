                        <h4>Procedure:</h4>
                        <li>Candidate seeking consideration for the rank of renshi must first seek approval from their
                            chief instructor and chief instructor approve application form. In the case that the chief
                            instructor is the candidate, candidate must then submit application to their regional
                            president or directly to the USNF President (in the case they may be either regional
                            president/executive secretary).
                        </li>
                        <li>Once approved, candidate must submit application form to their regional president (candidate
                            must include chief instructor and regional executive secretary in correspondence).
                        </li>
                        <li>The regional president must then inform the President of the USNF (include chief instructor,
                            regional president, regional executive secretary and USNF Executive Secretary in
                            correspondence).
                        </li>
                        <li>The President of the USNF will then inform the Shogo Committee (include chief instructor,
                            regional president, regional executive secretary and USNF Executive Secretary in
                            correspondence) to arrange a review of the candidate either after the annual March USNF
                            Board Meeting or National Seminar.
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Note to USNF Executive Secretary: AJNF must receive the application forms 30 days in
                                advance. INF must receive the application forms 30 days before the AJNF deadline. This
                                means the USNF Executive Secretary should send the INF forms about 60 days ahead of the
                                AJNF deadline (include Shogo, candidate, regional president, regional executive
                                secretary and USNF executive secretary). This should be double-checked with the INF
                                Executive Secretary.

                            <li>Note to Regional Executive Secretary and Candidate: Since the USNF forms are sent to the
                                INF 60 days ahead of the AJNF deadline, it is required that the full renshi application
                                is in hand, in both English and Japanese. Do not underestimate how long it will take to
                                complete this form due to its length and will require dates and other data regarding the
                                naginata career of the candidate. Do not underestimate how long it will take to complete
