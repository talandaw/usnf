                        develop their technical skills, cultivate their minds, enhance their vitality, nurture their
                        strength, preserve traditional Japanese culture embodied within the art of Naginata, maintain

                <p class="rightcolumntext">In this way, the USNF seeks to nurture members of good character, courtesy
                    and respect.</p>
                <p class="rightcolumntext">While USNF membership is defined, in part by the USNF By-laws as those who
                    have &ldquo;satisfied all their current fiscal obligations to the Federation,&rdquo; it is important
                    that members fully appreciate their roles within and obligations to the USNF upon acceptance into
                    the Federation. </p>
                <p class="rightcolumntext">Membership in the USNF is a voluntary decision, and as such, individuals
                    should recognize that as members of the federation, they are expected (to the best of their
                    abilities) to abide by the guidelines outlined in this Code of Conduct and Standards of
                    Behavior.</p>
                <p class="rightcolumntext">USNF members are representatives of the Federation. Their actions and
                    behavior are a reflection of their <em>sensei</em>, their <em>dojo</em>/club, their regional
                    federation and the USNF. Just as the USNF is responsible for promoting the principles and ideals of
                    Naginata, so too are its members responsible for exemplifying these principles, both in their
                    teaching and their conduct inside and outside the <em>dojo</em>. </p>
                <p class="rightcolumntext">The USNF By-laws provides guidelines for what constitutes USNF membership and
                    USNF membership in good standing. For a full list of these qualifications please reference sections
                    2.1 and 4.0. of the USNF By-laws (under “for members” menu).</p>

                            material on social media, online forums, and personal/public blogs. The changing nature of
                            internet privacy can make it difficult to limit the unintentional distribution of one&rsquo;s
                            personal comments. It is not uncommon for posted commentary or photographs, which may seem
                            innocuous or made out of context, to be misconstrued or their intent misinterpreted by
                            others. Such misunderstandings could lead to unforeseen political complications or
